# Provision & Seed DynamoDB Tables

If you are on this page, we are assuming that you've gone ahead and created a 'dynamodb-migrations' directory that
contains a `dynamo-landscaper.config.json` file that adheres to the required schema. If you haven't completed all of the steps
listed on the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page please go back and complete all of the prerequisite steps.

### How DynamoDB Gardner/Landscaper works

Once you've installed `dynamodb-landscaper` you will be able to execute
```sh
$ cd ./dynamodb-migrations
$ dynamodb-landscaper
```
from within the directory that contains your `dynamo-landscaper.config.json` file and all table definition files (We'll cover these table definition files below). When `dynamodb-landscaper` is executed on the command line from within this directory, DynamoDB Gardner/Landscaper will recursively traverse all table definition files in the directory and provision corresponding DynamoDB tables. Remember that DynamoDB Gardner/Landscaper will create a table for all `Environments` you've listed in your `dynamo-landscaper.config.json` file (Ex. 'foobar-dev', 'foobar-qa', 'foobar-prod', etc.).
